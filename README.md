# Notes
1. Please read [this excerpt](https://github.com/CreLox/IXNAnalysis/blob/master/PipelineDiagram%2BBiasElimination.pdf) from [my thesis](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/174669) for a basic understanding of how IXNAnalysis functions.

2. ``gmailMessage`` no longer works as of June 2022. Google has permanently banned the use of third-party apps for Gmail sign-in using only the username and password. Therefore, the ``gmailMessage`` p-file has been removed from this repo and related error messaging functionality in all batch-preprocessing scripts no longer works.
