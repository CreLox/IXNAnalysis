# Notes
1. ``gmailMessage`` no longer works as of June 2022. Google has permanently banned the use of third-party apps for Gmail sign-in using only the username and password. Therefore, the ``gmailMessage`` p-file has been removed from this repo and related error messaging functionality in all batch-preprocessing scripts no longer works.
